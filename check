ASIN Procurability Checker
Overview
The ASIN Procurability Checker is a tool designed to evaluate the procurability status of ASINs (Amazon Standard Identification Numbers) from the Amazon internal systems. The application uses Selenium to automate browser interactions, retrieve data, and save the results in a CSV file.

Saves results to a specified CSV file.
Handles cookies for authentication seamlessly.
Ensures proper error handling for missing files and browser failures.
Requirements
A valid login to access the https://midway-auth.amazon.com system.
Firefox installed on the system.
Network access to Amazon's internal systems.
Installation
Download the Executable File: Obtain the executable file of the ASIN Procurability Checker.

Exit: Press Enter after all ASINs are processed to exit the application.
Output
The output is a CSV file containing the following fields:

ASIN: The ASIN code.
